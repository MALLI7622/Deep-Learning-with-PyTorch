    "    1. In statistical analysis we are going to use p-value to know how confidence the model is, if the p-value value is higher that means that the model accuracy has by a chance, in contrast to it lower p-value indicates a significant statistical relation between the dependent variable and independent variable. Generally p < 0.05 is considered a significant, which says only 5% of the times the model has a randomness in prediction.\n",

On the other hand 'HistGradientBoostingClassifier' has a p-value of 0.01 which less than 0.05 ( p-value < 0.05 which considers highly significant). In this case 'HistGradientBoostingClassifier' has only 1% of randomness in prediction."
